## Plugins and whatnot



### Pathogen 
for easy plugin management

https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#readme

### Solarize
for colouring

https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized

Depends on iTerm being setup with Solarized colour schemes as well, otherwise it is like a clown car.

### Syntastic
For linting
